      "Variable is a some kind of container for specific values. for example you have number 32 and you want to assign it to variable x then you type x = 32. Variable can have different types if you want to write a text you need to use a string eg. 'hello world' you can write it in single or double quotes. Another variable type is integer this is just natural number (eg. 3) if you want to crate floating pint number you must use a float (eg. 3.1415). We got boolean type as well and this is true or false value. we can define variable which contains more variables in itself there are three types of this variables: list it contains variables in specific index's (eg. [23, 321.4, true, 'im a index number 3']), sets it contains unsorted values so you can't aces specific value (eg. {32, 'hello there', false})and last type is dictionary in dict. you can define your own indexes like this eg. {'name': 'John', 'surname': 'Silver-hand'}. if you want know more about specific values you can just ask me about it :)."
